<div><dd><p class="iy">The Indian Space Research Organisation[a] (ISRO; /ˈɪsroʊ/) is the national space agency of India,
     headquartered in Bangalore, which operates under the Department of Space (DOS) and is responsible for
      conducting space research, space exploration, and the development of technologies necessary for space-based 
      applications.</p>

    The Indian space programme started with INCOSPAR which was established in February 1962.
     It was later superseded by ISRO on 15th August 1969, to institutionalize space research in India. 
     In 1972, the Government of India set up a Space Commission and brought ISRO under the DOS.
      India's first satellite Aryabhata, which had been built and integrated by ISRO, 
      was launched in 1975 by the Interkosmos (Soviet Union). In 1980, ISRO launched the RS-1 satellite onboard SLV,
       its first launch vehicle making India the seventh country which was capable of undertaking orbital launches. 
       SLV was subsequently followed by the development of many launch vehicles, rocket engines,
        satellite systems and networks enabling the agency to launch hundreds of domestic and foreign satellites
         and conduct various deep space missions for space exploration. India became one of the few countries
          which had sent a spacecraft to the Moon in 2008 when its Chandrayaan probe entered the lunar orbit.
           The data from the probe eventually helped in confirming the existence of water on the lunar surface.
            ISRO launched the MOM spacecraft in 2013, which reached Mars on 24 September 2014, making India
             the first Asian nation, the fourth nation overall in the world, and also the first nation to have 
             achieved this milestone on the first try. ISRO launched a record number of 104 satellites in a PSLV, 
             from SDSC on 15th February 2017, which beat the previous Russian record of launching 37 satellites in 
             
             one rocket in 2014. A significant milestone in ISRO's history was achieved with the launch of GSAT-14 
             in a GSLV MK II having an Indian-made CE-7.5 cryogenic engine in 2014. With the success of this mission
             , ISRO became one of the six countries that have mastered this technology, demonstrated full launch
              capabilities and have sent extraterrestrial missions to other planets. On 5th June 2017, ISRO launched LVM3
               carrying GSAT-19 communications satellite. The mission was a success, making LVM3 the heaviest rocket to 
               be launched and the GSAT-19 satellite, the heaviest Indian payload to be launched into space till then.</dd>
